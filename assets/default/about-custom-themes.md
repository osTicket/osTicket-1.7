Customizng Your Theme
====

When modifying the default theme, it is recommended that you do not
edit the CSS files directly. Instead, you should use the included
LESS files and recompile the CSS file with your edits.

Even if you decide to edit the CSS directly, we recommend that you
keep the LESS files, so that you can quickly rebuild the default
theme should you need to recover it, or for upgrade purposes.

*Please do not submit any CSS edits to the official branch, unless
they are done within the LESS files.*
