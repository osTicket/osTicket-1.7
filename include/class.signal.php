/**
 * Signals implement a simple publish/subscribe event model. To keep things
 * simplistic between classes and to maintain compatible with PHP version 4,
 * signals will not be explicitly defined or registered. Instead, signals
 * are connected to callbacks via a string signal name.
 *
 * The system is proofed with a static inspection test which will ensure
 * that for every given Signal::connect() function call, somewhere else in
 * the codebase there exists a Signal::send() for the same named signal.

class Signal {
    /**
     * Subscribe to a signal.
     *
     * Signal::connect('user.auth', 'function');
     *
     * The subscribed function should receive a two arguments and will have
     * this signature:
     *
     * function callback($object, $data);
     *
     * Where the $object argument is the object originating the signal, and
     * the $options is a hash-array of other information originating from-
     * and pertaining to the signal.
     *
     * The value of the $data argument is not defined. It is signal
     * specific. It should be a hash-array of data; however, no runtime
     * checks are made to ensure such an interface.
     *
     * Optionally, if $object is a class and is passed into the ::connect()
     * method, only instances of the named class or subclass will actually
     * be connected to the callable function.
     *
     * A predicate function, $check, can be used to filter calls to the
     * signal handler. The function will receive the signal data and should
     * return true if the signal handler should be called.

     * interrupt or discontinue delivery of the signal to other subscribers.

     * Its interpretation is the object originating or sending the signal.
     * It could also be interpreted as the context of the signal.
     *
     * $data if sent should be a hash-array of data included with the signal
     * event. There is otherwise no definition for what should or could be
     * included in the $data array. The received data is received by
     * reference and can be passed to the callable by reference if the
     * callable is defined to receive it by reference. Therefore, it is
     * possible to propogate changes in the signal handlers back to the
     * originating context.
