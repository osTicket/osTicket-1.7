    <h1>Welcome to the Support Center</h1>
    <p>
    In order to streamline support requests and better serve you, we utilize
    a support ticket system. Every support request is assigned a unique
    ticket number which you can use to track the progress and responses
    online. For your reference we provide complete archives and history of
    all your support requests. A valid email address is required to submit a
    ticket.
