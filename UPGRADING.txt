Welcome to osTicket 1.7
=======================
Some tasks are better left to a system administrator rather than a mindless
upgrade script. These are those remaining things that we'd rather you take
care of:

  * Verify that your attachments have been successfully migrated to the
    database and removed from your server's filesystem. Once you're
    comfortable that they're all migrated, and that the remaining files are
    all failed uploads or orphans from deleted tickets, remove the folder
    where attachments were uploaded to.

  * Remove codebase files no longer utilized in osTicket 1.7. If you have
    console access to your server, a codebase-cleanup.sh script is provided
    for you in the setup/ folder to help you automatically take care of this.
    Otherwise, you may safely remove the following files from your codebase if
    they exist:

    * Removed in osTicket-1.6-rc5
      ostconfig.php

    * Removed in osTicket-1.6.0

    ticketing system.
