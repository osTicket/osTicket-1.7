            Please follow the instructions below to give read and write access to the web server user.
            <ul>
                <li><b>CLI</b>:<br><i>chmod 0666  include/ost-config.php</i></li>
                <li><b>FTP</b>:<br>Using WS_FTP this would be right hand clicking on the fil, selecting chmod, and then giving all permissions to the file.</li>
                <li><b>Cpanel</b>:<br>Click on the file, select change permission, and then giving all permissions to the file.</li>
